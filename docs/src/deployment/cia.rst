Configuration Inspection API
============================

The Configuration Inspector API is a |FastAPI| implementation that gives the consumer configuration information for the Helm Charts that are deployed and the resultant DeviceServers (as well as versions for all of the above-mentioned items) in a namespaced deployment of SKA Software.

The API is documented using the standard |OpenAPI| specification, and this can be reached in similar fashion to the `branch-names-and-access-patterns`_.
