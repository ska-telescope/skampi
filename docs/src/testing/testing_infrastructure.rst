.. _`Testing Runway`:

Testing SKAMPI using the Testing Runway (SKALLOP)
*************************************************

The testing infrastructure for SKAMPI is constantly changing as improved methods for interacting with the clusters are sought, and therefore remains very much a work in progress.

Refer to the `Confluence page on installation of SKALLOP for BDD tests <https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SE/Skallop+installation+for+BDD+tests>`_ in the meantime for learning how to run BDD tests on SKAMPI.

Also, for implementing tests using Skallop refer to the `Skallop documentation <https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/ska-ser-skallop/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_.
