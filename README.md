[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ska-telescope-skampi/badge/?version=latest)](https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/skampi/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Before you begin
The documentation for SKAMPI is currently being reworked. To look at the documentation that was available before this rework started, please go to [this temporary build on ReadtheDocs](https://developer.skao.int/projects/skampi/en/sp-1747-docs-old/).

For information on how to use the subsystems / components that are deployed using SKAMPI, please first look at the documentation on [SKAMPI Subsystems](https://developer.skao.int/projects/skampi/en/latest/subsystems.html)

If you're developing (or planning to develop or contribute to) a component or subsystem that is to be integrated in a Kubernetes cluster, read on. If you are a tester, it is also recommended that you gain at least a basic understanding of the concepts before jumping to the section on [Testing](#testing).
### SKA Tango Examples
If your component or product is ready for integration, skip the following sections and go to [Development](#development).

A basic understanding of the [SKA Tango Examples](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/ska-tango-examples/) repository is required before attempting to integrate a component on SKAMPI. Please visit the repository and base your development on the examples given there. More info on this in the [Documentation](https://developer.skao.int/projects/skampi/en/latest/helm.html).
